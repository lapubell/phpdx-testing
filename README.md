# PHP Unit Testing Demo Talk

Maybe you've been to a testing talk before. I've been to a few. This code is here to help me talk through some introductoray concepts. I'll show how we can go from some standard procedural code to some code that is testable and tested.

Come along for the ride!

## Steps

* Install PHPUnit
```
composer require phpunit/phpunit
```

* Create Tests folder
```
mkdir tests
```

* Create Class
```
touch Validator.php
```

* Write tests, and code to pass the tests. Huzzah!
